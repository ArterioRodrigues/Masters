    <h1 class="text-center">Chapter 1.1 The Product Vision</h1>
    <p>
        Your starting point for product development should be an informal “product vision.” A product vision is a simple and succinct statement that defines the essence of the product that is being developed. It explains how the product differs from other competing products. This product vision is used as a basis for developing a more detailed description of the features and attributes of the product. As new features are proposed, you should check them against the vision to make sure they contribute to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The product vision should answer three fundamental questions
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>What is the product that you propose to develop? What makes this product different from competing products?</li>
        <li>Who are the target users and customers for the product?</li>
        <li>Why should customers buy this product?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>7</h3>

    <p>
        The need for the first question is obvious—before you start, you need to know what you are aiming for. The other questions concern the commercial viability of the product. Most products are intended for use by customers outside of the development team. You need to understand their background to create a viable product that these customers will find attractive and be willing to buy.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you search the web for “product vision,” you will find several variants of these questions and templates for expressing the product vision. Any of these templates can be used. The template that I like comes from the book Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore.1 Moore suggests using a structured approach to writing the product vision based on keywords:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>FOR (target customer)</li>
        <li>WHO (statement of the need or opportunity)</li>
        <li>The (PRODUCT NAME) is a (product category)</li>
        <li>THAT (key benefit, compelling reason to buy)</li>
        <li>UNLIKE (primary competitive alternative)</li>
        <li>OUR PRODUCT (statement of primary differentiation)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        On his blog Joel on Software, Joel Spolsky gives an example of a product described using this vision template:
        <a href="https://plus.pearson.com/epub/bronte/BRNT-1I3R8EU02TY/v4/OPS/xhtml/9833bcc0-0383-11ed-8eed-2cd40f036b96.xhtml#7ba483e7-4d4a-4796-aa71-ca89bb977c82">2</a>
    </p>
   
    <p style="padding-left: 10px;">
        <i>
            FOR a mid-sized company’s marketing and sales departments WHO need basic CRM functionality, THE CRM-Innovator is a Web-based service THAT provides sales tracking, lead generation, and sales representative support features that improve customer relationships at critical touch points. UNLIKE other services or package software products, OUR product provides very capable services at a moderate cost
        </i>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can see how this vision answers the key questions that I identified above:
    </p>

    <h3>8</h3>
    //////////////////////////
    <p>
        Software projects involve an external client or customer who decides on the 
        functionality of the system and enters into a legal contract with the software 
        development company. The customer’s problem and current processes are used as a 
        basis for creating the software requirements, which specify the software to be 
        implemented. As the business changes, the supporting software has to change. 
        The company using the software decides on and pays for the changes. Software 
        often has a long lifetime, and the costs of changing large systems after 
        delivery usually exceed the initial software development costs.
    </p>

    <p>
        As development costs are spread over a much larger customer base, product-based 
        software is usually cheaper, for each customer, than custom software. However, 
        buyers of the software have to adapt their ways of working to the software, since 
        it has not been developed with their specific needs in mind. As the developer 
        rather than the user is in control of changes, there is a risk that the developer 
        will stop supporting the software. Then the product customers will need to find 
        an alternative product
    </p>

    <h3>3</h3>
    <p>
        The starting point for product development is an opportunity that a company has 
        identified to create a viable commercial product. This may be an original idea, 
        such as Airbnb’s idea for sharing accommodations; an improvement over existing 
        systems, such as a cloud-based accounting system; or a generalization of a 
        system that was developed for a specific customer, such as an asset management 
        system.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because the product developer is responsible for identifying the opportunity, 
        they can decide on the features that will be included in the software product. 
        These features are designed to appeal to potential customers so that there is 
        a viable market for the software.
    </p>

    <p>
        As well as the differences shown in <a href="#img1">Figures 1.1</a> and 
        <a href="#img1">1.2</a>, there are two other important differences between 
        project-based and product-based software engineering:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Product companies can decide when to change their product or take their 
                product off the market. If a product is not selling well, the company can 
                cut costs by stopping its development. Custom software developed in a 
                software project usually has a long lifetime and has to be supported 
                throughout that lifetime. The customer pays for the support and decides 
                when and if it should end.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                For most products, getting the product to customers quickly is critical. 
                Excellent products often fail because an inferior product reaches the market 
                first and customers buy that product. In practice, buyers are reluctant to 
                change products after they have invested time and money in their initial 
                choice.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Bringing the product to the market quickly is important for all types of 
        products, from small-scale mobile apps to enterprise products such as 
        Microsoft Word. This means that engineering techniques geared to rapid 
        software development (agile methods) are universally used for product 
        development. I explain agile methods and their role in product development 
        in <a href="../Chapter 2/Chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you read about software products, you may come across two other terms: 
        “software product lines” and “platforms” (<a href="#table1">Table 1.1</a>). Software product lines 
        are systems designed to be adaptable to meet the specific needs of customers 
        by changing parts of the source code. Platforms provide a set of features 
        that can be used to create new functionality. However, you always have to 
        work within the constraints defined by the platform suppliers.
    </p>

            <td>
                <p>
                    A set of software products that share a common core. Each member of the 
                    product line includes customer-specific adaptations and additions. Software 
                    product lines may be used to implement a custom system for a customer with 
                    specific needs that can’t be met by a generic product.For example, a company 
                    providing communication software to the emergency services may have a 
                    software product line where the core product includes basic communication 
                    services such as receive and log calls, initiate an emergency response, pass 
                    information to vehicles, and so on. However, each customer may use different 
                    radio equipment and their vehicles may be equipped in different ways. The 
                    core product has to be adapted for each customer to work with the equipment 
                    that they use.

                    A software (or software+hardware) product that includes functionality so that 
                    new applications can be built on it. An example of a platform that you probably 
                    use is Facebook. It provides an extensive set of product functionality but also 
                    provides support for creating “Facebook apps.” These add new features that may 
                    be used by a business or a Facebook interest group.

        When software products were first developed, they were delivered on a disk 
        and installed by customers on their computers. The software ran on those 
        computers and user data were stored on them. There was no communication 
        between the users’ computers and the vendor’s computers. Now, customers can 
        download products from either an app store or the vendor’s website. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Some products are still based on a stand-alone execution model in which all 
        computation is carried out on the product owner’s computers. However, 
        ubiquitous high-speed networking means that alternative execution models are 
        now available. In these models, the product owner’s computers act as a client, 
        with some or all execution and data storage on the vendor’s servers 
        (<a href="#img3">Figure 1.3</a>).
    </p>

    <img width ="75%" id="img3" src="../assets/Chapter-1/firgure1.3.png"/>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Hybrid products Some functionality is implemented on the user’s computer 
            and some on the product vendor’s servers that are accessed over the 
            Internet. Many phone apps are hybrid products with computationally 
            intensive processing offloaded to remote servers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Service-based products Applications are accessed over the Internet from a 
            web browser or an app. There may be some local processing using Javascript,
            but most computation is carried out on remote servers. More and more 
            product companies are converting their products to services because it 
            simplifies product updating and makes new business models, such as 
            pay-as-you-go, feasible. I cover service-oriented systems in 
            <a href="../Chapter5.html">Chapters 5 </a> and <a href="../Chapter6.html"></a>6.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>5</h3>

    <p>
        As I have said, the key characteristic of product development is that there is 
        no external customer who generates software requirements and pays for the 
        software. This is also true for some other types of software development:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Student projects As part of a computing or engineering course, students 
            may be set assignments in which they work in groups to develop software.
            The group is responsible for deciding on the features of the system and 
            how to work together to implement these features.  
        </li>
        <li>
            Research software Software is developed by a research team to support
            their work. For example, climate research depends on large-scale climate 
            models that are designed by researchers and implemented in software. On a 
            smaller scale, an engineering group may build software to model the 
            characteristics of the material they are using.
        </li>
        <li>
            Internal tool development A software development team may decide that it 
            needs some specific tools to support their work. They specify and 
            implement these tools as “internal” products.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>6</h3>

    <p>
        You can use the product development techniques that I explain here for any 
        type of software development that is not driven by external customer 
        requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is a common view that software product engineering is simply advanced 
        programming and that traditional software engineering is irrelevant. All you 
        need to know is how to use a programming language plus the frameworks and 
        libraries for that language. This is a misconception and I have written this 
        book to explain the activities, apart from programming, that I believe are 
        essential for developing high-quality software products.
    </p>

    <p>
        If your product is to be a success, you need to think about issues other than 
        programming. You must try to understand what your customers need and how 
        potential users can work with your software. You need to design the overall 
        structure of your software (software architecture) and know about technologies
        such as cloud computing and security engineering. You need to use 
        professional techniques for verifying and testing your software and code 
        management systems to keep track of a changing codebase.
    </p>

    <p>
        You also need to think about the business case for your product. You must sell 
        your product to survive. Creating a business case may involve market research,
        an analysis of competitors, and an understanding of the ways that target 
        customers live and work. This book is about engineering, however, not 
        business, so I don’t cover business and commercial issues here.
